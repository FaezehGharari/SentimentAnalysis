# SentimentAnalysis
In this repository, I developed a Bernoulli Naive Bayes model to analyze the sentiment of over 1.6 million tweets, achieving an accuracy of 80%. You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140) and the Kaggle project [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/faezehgharari/sentiment-analysis).
